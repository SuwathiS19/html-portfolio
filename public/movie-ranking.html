<p>It is the first installment in the Avatar film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.</p>
<h2>Avengers:Endgame</h2>

<p>The film has a sense of grandeur that most other Marvel films try to replicate but fail at it almost every time. The story picks up where Infinity War left off. Half of all life has been wiped out by the mad Titan Thanos, leaving only a handful of Avengers to salvage the remnants of the Thanos-snap</p>
<h2>Titanic</h2>

<p>Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage.</p>
